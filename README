targetcli is an administration tool for managing the LIO Linux SCSI Target,
and its third-party target fabric modules and backend storage objects.
The targetcli CLI is built on top of the python configshell CLI framework.

targetcli was developed by Datera, Inc. (www.daterainc.com). It is useful
for developing 3rd-party applications, and as a foundation for the Datera
userspace tools.
