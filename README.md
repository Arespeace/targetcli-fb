"fb" -- "free branch"
---------------------

targetcli-fb is a fork of the "targetcli" code written by RisingTide Systems.
The "-fb" differentiates between the original and this version.
Please ensure to use either all "fb" versions of the targetcli components --
targetcli, rtslib, and configshell, or stick with all non-fb versions, since
they are no longer strictly compatible.
